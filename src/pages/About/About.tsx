          <p className="text-gray-light text-sm leading-relaxed">
            I was born and raised in Canada, near the rocky mountains. As an adult I have lived in
            several states including Hawaii, Louisiana, Virginia, and Texas. While there were things
            I enjoyed about each of these places, I'm happy I found my way back to the mountains,
            this time in Utah. I love hiking, camping and rock climbing and just enjoying the
            beautiful outdoors with my husband and four children.

          <p className="text-gray-light text-sm leading-relaxed">
            I have always loved to draw and remember being very inspired as a 5 year old,
            overhearing a proud grandma brag about how her grandson could draw whatever he wanted
            just from his imagination. As a teen I took lessons from a watercolor artist in my
            community, Rene Hill. As I approached college I was incredibly intimidated by the idea
            of submitting a portfolio and got my bachelor's degree in history and German instead.

          <p className="text-gray-light text-sm leading-relaxed">
            I started studying art more seriously in 2022 after my youngest son was born. I've had
            the privilege of learning from artists like Emily Fox King, Andrew Payne, and Kirk
            Richards at the J. Kirk Richards Studio Academy over the past few years.
            <br />
            <br />I have learned to love oil painting, and how a painting can communicate a feeling
            in a way words can't. My painting practice has become a refuge for me from the wonderful
            chaos that is raising children. It helps me to recharge, and step back to see the beauty
            in the commotion of my day to day life.
